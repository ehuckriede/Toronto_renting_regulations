This repository belongs to our research into the effect of Toronto's operation to recover the housing market by implementing a new set of regulations on September 10, 2020. This research is performed as a part of the [Data Preparation and Workflow Management](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com) course at Tilburg University. In this research we answer the following research question:


__How did the implemented rental market regulations in Toronto affect rental prices on AirBnB?__

## Motivation

Many cities around the world are dealing with increasing housing prices due to the attractiveness of short term rentals. In order to deal with this problem, local governments in cities like [Amsterdam](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-airbnb-amsterdam-idUSKBN2B81NS), [Barcelona](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/travel/barcelona-airbnb.html) and [Atlanta](https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/atlanta-delays-new-rules-for-airbnb-other-short-term-rentals/HDTLILUK2NHEPEW5LRABO3Z7FA/) have implemented new regulations to make the short term rental market less attractive in the past year.  

The city of Toronto was dealing with the same issue and implemented some [new rules](https://toronto.citynews.ca/2020/08/25/toronto-introduces-new-rules-for-airbnb-other-short-term-rental-platforms/) for the short term rental market, which also affects AirBnB operators, in september last year. By examing the results of these regulations this could form as a case for other cities dealing with the same issues as of now.

The new rules in Toronto implied the following:
- You have to register your AirBnB unit at the City of Toronto. After you have registered, you have to pay a $50 renewal fee per year. 
- The registered AirBnB owners have to pay a Municipal Accommodation Tax of 4% on a quarterly basis. 
- You will not be able to list properties on AirBnB if it is not your primary residence. This means that you can only AirBnB your home, whether that is a part of it or all of it. 

After the implementation of these rules, fewer listings will probably be available on AirBnB. This can result in three scenarios for the price of the listings: 

- The price of the listings could increase
- The price of the listings could not change significantly
- The price of the listings could decrease (while not very likely)

As the regulations can these three different scenario's it is important that the effects of these regulations are examined. So we aim to conclude whether these regulations had the intended effect in Toronto. With these results other cities facing the same prolem, might implement or might not implement similar short term rental market regulations.
